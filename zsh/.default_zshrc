# Wiki
# Common conventions to make user defined fuctions:
# 1. Always make a .zshfn dir if not exist in ~/ .
# 2. Add file with the name of fuction you want to define.
# 3. File should be extensionless.(eg. clicolors)
# 4. Paste below lines to load the files.

# To load user define funtions into zsh.
# fpath=( ~/.zshfn "${fpath[@]}" )
# For now only load clicolors.
# timezsh takes too much time while sourcing.
# autoload -Uz clicolors

# For loading all the function in the file name ~/.zshfn
# This should be preferred.
# autoload -Uz $fpath[1]/*(.:t)

# We won't need this two source lines unless installing fzf manually
# source /usr/share/doc/fzf/examples/key-bindings.zsh
# source /usr/share/doc/fzf/examples/completion.zsh
# oh-my-zsh fzf does the work ig.
